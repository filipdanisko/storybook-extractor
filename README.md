# Storybook extractor

> ðŸ”¥  This project was done as a part of 24h [design systems hackathon 2022](https://www.dshackathon.de/) there are some [known issues](#known-issues) as a result of that.

Storybook extractor is a tool that extracts data from storybook stories, documentation pages and generates a JSON file with them.

**Features**:

- Extracts metadata from storybook globals
- Takes a screenshot of the storybook component
- Extracts docs page HTML

Running `storybook-extractor` on URL where storybook is running will output JSON like this:

  Some of the properties are shorten for readability.

With this raw JSON report you can generate what do you desire, for example:

- Generate snippets for IDE with all components from storybook
- Get storybook docs pages into your custom documentation page
- Feed Algolia search with you components data

# Install

```
npm install --save-dev storybook-extractor
```

# Usage

You need to run the extractor with a path to a config file.

```
npx storybook-extractor -c /path/to/storybook-extractor.config.js
```

## Config file arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| url | string | URL to storybook instance |
| output | string | Path to output file |
| concurentScrapers | number | Number of concurrent scrapers, defaults to 20 |
| postProcess | String[] | Path to post processor |

### Example config file

```
module.exports = {
  url: "http://localhost:4400",
  output: "./out.json",
  concurentScrapers: 20,
  postProcess: ["./examples/example-post-process.js"],
};
```

## Custom post process

This extractor only produces raw data which can be quite large, because of that there is an option to specify `postProcess` in your config file to run scripts after extractor, like this:

```js
  postProcess: [".path/to/your/script.js"],
```

After the extractor is finished scraping it will execute specified processes. Note that those processes are not chained.

# Known issues

- Docs pages are being scraped multiple times. As for a component you can have multiple stories which have unique URLs and previews but don't have unique doc pages.
- Not everything is TS typed
- The Config file is required right now, having CLI commands would be more friendly
- No tests
